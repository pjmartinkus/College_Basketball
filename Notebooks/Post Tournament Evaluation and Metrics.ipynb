    "Unfortunately, not too well. While I can chalk some of the bad performance this year down to COVID, ultimately predicting the NCAA Tournament will never be easy and bad years are bound to happen. I think the game cancellations from COVID did have a pretty big impact on the reliability of our team metrics this year because many of them occurred during non-conference play. This lack of data between conferences made it even harder than usual to adjust efficiency metrics like Kenpom based on strength of schedule because there weren't many data points to compare teams in different conferences. For example, the Big Ten had strong Kenpom stats across the board. Perhaps the conference's bad performance was a results of inflated ratings from conference play between teams that were never actually tested against other conferences. \n",

    "Overall, I'll need to go back to the drawing board and make some adjustments in the future, particularly to how I pick the actual tournament winners. Since going exactly with whether or not the model predicts an upset results in far too few upset predictions, I lowered the threshold of the predicted probability required to pick an upset. I have yet to come up with a method f"
