It's honestly incredible how frequently this bracket has predicted the winner even if you account for some favorites winning it over the last few years and I honestly don't expect this trend to continue.\n",

The overall accuracy and adjusted accuracy were down compared to previous seasons, but the upset precision and recall metrics were overall slightly up. This is mostly due to there being more upsets than previous seasons, so I think it's fair to say that the model actually was better than previous years, but the frequent number of upsets caused overall accuracy to be lower in spite of that.\n",
