def predict(model, games, features):
    """
    Generates predictions for the given NCAA Tournament using a list of the games
    for the first round. The games DataFrame should follow the same format as the
    training data used to train the input classifier. The games should be ordered such
    that the winner of games in consecutive rows will play in the next round. This
    function will then generate predictions for each of the games and then continue
    making predictions for each of the later rounds until the champion is predicted.


    Args:
        model(Scikit-Learn Classifier): A trained Scikit-Learn classifier.
        games(DataFrame): A DataFrame containing all of the matchups in the first
                          round of the tournament.
        features(list): A list of the features that will be used to generate
                        predictions with the classifier.

    Returns:
        A pandas DataFrame that includes the names of the favored team, underdog,
        predicted winner and the probability returned by the classifier for each
        game in the tournament for the input data.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If games is not of type pandas DataFrame.
